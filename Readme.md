This repository contains three ways of connecting to a simple Pipecat voice agent which uses SmallWebRTCTransport.

1. Connecting from server/index.html - This uses a simple HTML page with a WebRTC connection to the server.
2. Connecting from client/src/direct/App.tsx - This uses a simple React app with a WebRTC connection to the server.
3. Connecting from client/src/pipecat-library/App.tsx - This uses the Pipecat library to connect to the server.

1 & 2 work both locally and in Recall.ai (https://www.recall.ai/). 
3 works only locally. It does not work in Recall.ai
